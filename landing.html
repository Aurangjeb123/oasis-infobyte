                <h2>Its My<br> <span>True story</span></h2>
                <p>I was born in a middle class Indian family. Since the age I
                 got to understand this world I saw my parents working hard all 
                 day and night. I learned at a very young age the struggles that
                 my parents faced. I was good in studies from childhood and that
                 was the biggest thing my parents were proud of. At the end of each
                 long day my dad would say to my mom, "I will give my son the best 
                 education, he will not struggle like this. What I was unable to do,
                 my son will do." My father wanted to become a <b>Teacher</b> but could not make
                 his dream true, as my grandfather didn't provide him money to get admission. 
                 My father then left his studies and opened a Agriculture. I was in grade seven
                 when I lost my interest in studies and I moved towards working. I used to go the
                 Agriculture with my father to help him. I clearly told him that I want to be with you,
                want to help you, want to work with you and along with that I will also continue my studies.
                My father never forced me for any specific thing. He wanted me to do the things in which I was
                interested. My life went on like this and I was the youngest among my friends to work. Taking each
                moment as a learning experience, I learned what it means to deserve what you worked hard for. continue.....</p>
